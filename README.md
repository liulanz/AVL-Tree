# AVL-Tree

The program will reads an input file (i.e. rebase210.txt) and store data into an AVL Tree.

You can compile everything by typing "make clean" , "make all"

You can compile one program individually by just typing make <Program Name>, 
for example, "make query_tree"

By typing "make clean"
	You delete all .o files and executables.

For part 1
	You need a database file such as "rebase210.txt"
	You will type "make query_tree"
	To execute the code you will type "./query_tree rebase210.txt"
	
For part 2
	You will need a database file and a queries file. For example, "rebase210.txt" and sequences.txt"
	You will type "make test_tree"
	To execute the code you will type "./test_tree rebase210.txt sequences.txt"

For part 3
  Part 2 and part 2 will print the same result, but the double rotation is implement differently.
	You will need a database file and a queries file. For example, "rebase210.txt" and sequences.txt"
	You will type "make test_tree_mod"
	To execute the code you will type "./test_tree_mod rebase210.txt sequences.txt"
